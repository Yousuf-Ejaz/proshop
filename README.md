## Project Structure

I structured the application based on MVC Architecture. MVC stands for Model, View and Controller. This application presents a clear demarcation between the Model, View and Controller logics:

1. The `Model` logic is managed by Redux and Redux toolkit. Redux store decides what data the app should contain according to the current state. If the state of this data changes, then the `View` is notified. It is Implemented and managed using `Store`, `Reducers`, `Constants` and `Actions`.
2. The `View` logic is handled using `BootStrap` Elements. It renders elements using `React` and by monitoring the changes in the `Model` logic or the store state.
3. The `Controller` contains the implemtation and logic to all the routes which ultimately updates the model and/or view in response to input from the users of the app.
